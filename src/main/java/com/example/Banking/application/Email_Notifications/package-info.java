 * It includes functionality for sending notifications about account activity,
 * such as successful transactions.
 *
 * The {@code Notification} class stores details like notification ID, account ID,
 * email address, subject, message body, and the date the notification was sent.
 *
 * Lombok annotations {@code @NoArgsConstructor}, {@code @AllArgsConstructor}, and
 * {@code @Builder} are used to simplify the code by generating constructors and
 * builder patterns automatically.
